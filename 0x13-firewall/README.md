                                              Firewall
In this project, I used ufw to configure firewall on my issued webservers

        Tasks
0. Block all incoming traffic but - Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
22 (SSH)
443 (HTTPS SSL)
80 (HTTP)

1. Port forwarding - Configure my webserver so that its firewall redirects port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP
